Heartbeat Sound Segmentation and Classification
### This repo presents the journey taken in planning, designing, implementing and presenting our final year lab project.

### Introduction

* According to WHO, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD's) continue to be one of the leading causes of deaths globally.  
* To check for any CVD's (abnormalities) in patients' heartbeat sounds, medical practitioners currently use a method known as cardiac auscultation.
* This is a process whereby a medical practitioner listens to the heart sound, analyses it and classifies it as normal or abnormal.
* Generally it is a difficult skill to acquire considering the complexity of abnormal heart sounds.
* An easily accessible and reliable heartbeat sound classification system would be vital in reducing high mortality rates due to CVD's and also assist medical practitioners with more accurate cardiac auscultation.

### Project Objectives
* To implement a method which can locate _lub_ and _dub_ sounds (S1 and S2) within audio data, segment the files and classify heartbeats into normal or diseased categories.
* To create a model that will enable a first level screening of detecting abnormalities in an individuals heart sound.
