      \item According to WHO, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD's) continue to be one of the leading causes of deaths globally.  
      \item To check for any CVD's (abnormalities) in patients' heartbeat sounds, medical practitioners currently use a method known as cardiac auscultation.
      \item This is a process whereby a medical practitioner listens to the heart sound, analyses it and classifies it as normal or abnormal.
      \item Generally it is a difficult skill to acquire considering the complexity of abnormal heart sounds.
      \item An easily accessible and reliable heartbeat sound classification system would be vital in reducing high mortality rates due to CVD's and also assist medical practitioners with more accurate cardiac auscultation.

      \item ANN performed best with high class precisions, however it was unable to classify Extrasystole heart sounds.
      \item This is due to a small training set used and Extrasystoles having similar characteristics to normal heart sounds.

 ANN classifier was found to be the most promising audio heart sounds classifier. For future work, an equally distributed training set & distinct Extra-systole features are recommended.

      \item To create a model that will enable a first level screening of detecting abnormalities in an individuals heart sound.

            \item For home use by individuals using a smartphone.
